The goal is to come up with a function $f(X): \\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that minimizes the squared-error loss $(Y - f(X))^2$. Since X, Y are random variables, we seek to minimize the expectation of the squared error loss as follows\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",

For example, linear regression explicitly assumes that the regression function is approximately linear in its arguments, i.e. $\\hat{f}(x) = x^T\\beta$ while a neural network provides a nonlinear approximation of the regression function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest of all these methods is [k-nearest neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm). Given $x$ and some neighbourhood of $k$ points $N_k(x)$, $\\hat{f}(x)$ is simply the average of all $y_i|x_i \\in N_k(x)$.  Let $N$ denote the training sample size. Under mild regularity conditions on the joint probability distribution $Pr(X, Y)$, one can show that as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ such that $k/N \\rightarrow 0$, then $\\hat{f}(x) \\rightarrow f(x)$ where $\\rightarrow$ means approaches or goes to. In other words, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm converges to the ideal solution as both the training sample size and number of neighbors increase to infinity.\n",
